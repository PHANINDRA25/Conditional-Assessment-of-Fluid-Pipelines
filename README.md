# Conditional-Assessment-of-Fluid-Pipelines

## Problem Statement :
Approx 1.5 billion liters of fluid is leaked through pipelines in India. Our goal is to come up with a cost-effective solution to redce the wastage of resources.

Our project deals with designing a setup that makes use of acoustic sensors for leak detection and monitoring fluid flow parameters in a pipeline. We have implemented  interdisciplinary knowledge of CAD modelling,manufacturing, sensor coding on Arduino to prepare a working model called as Smart Sphere which rolls into the pipeline during its function.

We have performed data collection and storage in cloud & analyzed the sensor data in Th!ingspeak IOT platform. We made use of GPS tracer, SD card for backup storage , WiFi module inside the sphere for seamless data transfer. 
We have tested it in a static condition and yielded significant results in locating the leak of diameter more than 0.5cm.
